0,8 December 2017,3," Not the greatest app especially not ezactly pay as you go freindly. Would be nice if the first page you see wasn't log in details as being a new customer of O2, I found this very confusing at first (couldn't register for one thing). At least one can see what one has left on your Balance. Personally, could be better organised- 1st class service though, very helpful staff in the shop!    ",
1,31 December 2017,5," Really useful to keep up-to-date with my data, minutes and texts. Also I can look at offers and upgrades, and if I need to add any bolt ons. There is also link to the online forum should I need it. Haven't had any problems with the app so far.    ",
2,10 January 2018,5," Great app. Easy to use. Integrates well with features on my phone like the fingerprint scanner. Gets a bit weird when you have two O2 contracts as you can't monitor multiple phones through the same app. However, this got sorted and I haven't had any issues since.    ",
3,3 January 2018,1, Tried using it today (4/01/18) and it keeps crashing out?! Can't remember when I last used it so don't know if the last update is the issue? I have an Honor 8 mobile phone. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling but still no joy :-/    ,
4,14 December 2017,5," Love it. Quite simply, it does what it's supposed to. I can easily check how much data I have left in my allowance, as well as see what chargeable calls or texts I've made/sent in the last few days. Tells me what my next bill will be, and gives me a breakdown of it, as well as let me pay my current bill. Not much more to ask for really. Note, I use a Galaxy A5 (2017). Admittedly, it would be nice to have kept it so it still accepts my fingerprint, without having to set that option as my phone's lock screen security, but hey, a pin number is just as quick as far as I'm concerned.    ",
5,19 January 2018,4, Would get 5stars if I could transfer an account to my Son after transferring the actual account. I have to do his top ups if he needs any!    ,
6,11 December 2017,5," Does all I want, main purpose is to tell me how much data I still have. To be fair I don't use it for much else, the local shop staff are brilliant so I do everything else there ‚ò∫Ô∏è    ",
7,11 December 2017,5, Decent enough app although it does crash on opening quite a lot! I'm happy that I can keep all the numbers on my contract in one place... it might be even better if all o2 apps could be in the same place as Well!    ,
8,17 December 2017,4, Does the intended job but suffers lots of start up crashes/errors. Great layout and I feel every aspect of my account is acessable    ,
9,29 December 2017,5," Really good. Always able to see what's left of my data and allowances. Only issue is that it keeps saying I have 1 bill ready, when I'm not the bill payer and it's from months ago.    ",
10,8 December 2017,2," Some update how they treat the customers. Just before the black friday 2017 i,v got the text from o2, that i have been selected as a loyality costumer to get??? a huge discount/deal for new phone/plan etc. They did text to me ""we will be contact with you after the upcoming black friday"", in fact that newer happenü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°, they even did not contact with me after all. My question are we can trust them??????  Frankly i can wait the time when my contract comes to and end AllelujaüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ.  Again my appeal to anyone who are about to sign up with them, just think twice before do that/this.    ",
11,14 January 2018,4," Really useful to keep tabs on everyone's usage, as I have both children on my contract. The only thing that lets it down is the technical issues that occur relatively frequently.    ",
12,15 January 2018,5," Handy, always seems to work and tells me what I want to know. The offers pop ups can be a bit tedious though.    ",
13,29 December 2017,3," It is a good app I can keep track of my bill and my kids but recently I'm not able to pay my contracts on it, it keeps telling me to contact my bank and come back and try again after I have spoken to them. I have done that their is no problem with my card or my account and yet I still can't pay through the o2 app üòï    ",
14,20 January 2018,5, It's simple and easy to use. Want to check your bill? No problem. Worried about how much data you have left?  A quick check and off you go.    ,
15,10 December 2017,3, Bit clunky but does the job. Crashes on startup about 50% of the time. Could be better.    ,
16,15 January 2018,3," Generally useful, but there used to be a circle icon showing how many days left of that billing period, which could be easily compared with the similar image showing how much data you had left, and it has gone from the latest versions. It was super helpful, please put it back!    ",
17,20 January 2018,5," Great app! Easy to use and connects to fingerprints so no one can access it.....easy to pay bills, add bundles, view future bills etc. Very handy to have especially on contract as it has all 3 of them in one place to track and check my data.    ",
18,24 December 2017,5," Great for checking out your bill or recent charges. Also, if you have two accounts they both show up.    ",
19,2 January 2018,4," Handy app for thoose who are on contract. So far so good, I'm just hopibg they can keep it up to update and reliable as mobile service apps have a habit of being poor.    ",
20,28 December 2017,5," Easy to use with quick tabs to break things down. First page tells me exactly what i need to know: Data, extra charges, texts left , minutes left.    ",
21,5 January 2018,4, This app is very useful. I can see how much data I'm using. Shame it doesn't work on Wi-Fi.    ,
22,11 December 2017,4, It's very easy to use. Only reservation is that no matter what I do I always seem to have an outstanding notification    ,
23,21 December 2017,4, Does what it's meant to do. Easy to understand tabs with minimal adverts/promo. Does occasionally crash when first opening. But still impressed    ,
24,8 December 2017,3, Handy little app. Can however be a bit temperamental at times.    ,
25,17 January 2018,5, I love it as I can keep track of our phone bills and if need be pay. That's the best thing as calling o2 can be stressful    ,
26,18 December 2017,4, Easy to use. Only thing to mention is for.some reason I always have to put in my pin even if not using WiFi.    ,
27,20 January 2018,5," Very good app. Those who said different, they are stupid. Thank You O2    ",
28,4 January 2018,5," I used to be on ee before switching to 02 ,  the ee app I had previous was awful compared to this very clear on things easy to use and we'll layed out unlike previous network    ",
29,28 December 2017,5," It does exactly as it says on the tin, sometimes the option to upgrade doesn't take you strait to the list of phones and tablets avaliable though if I do have one minor gripe.    ",
30,28 December 2017,5, U can easly pay off ur contract if u go over the top off minutes or texts and u can view ur bill at any time and u can see how much date u have uesed    ,
31,29 December 2017,4, it would be 5* but in the upgrade section it is damn near impossible to scroll down past the iPhone offers to the make/model selection as the page keeps pinging back to iPhone. I DO NOT WANT AN IPHONE    ,
32,4 January 2018,5, Handy app to have to track monthly activity. I haven't had any issues with the app on my Google device.    ,
33,16 December 2017,5, I think its great can't see any problems with it at all. Keep up the good work o2    ,
34,3 January 2018,5," Easy to use helps to keep up-to-date on current data & charges etc available - only criticism- frequently Asked Questions - What happens if yours Isn't? Hard to find contact number then to speak to a ""person""!    ",
35,4 January 2018,5," I love it, never had a problem. Has everything i need in one place. The data counter is the best thing for me!    ",
36,14 December 2017,4, Great app. But there have been a few instances when the data allowance has not been available to view for no apparent reason    ,
37,1 January 2018,5, Great app very easy 2 use I can keep track off how much I'm spending on my contract and pay off ne amount owed from the comfort of my home brill I can't recommend this app enough    ,
38,21 January 2018,5, Good app useful to have will keep to my five stars but seems slow on updating paid bills so makes you think there's still pay missing    ,
39,15 January 2018,5, I like the app only problem I have is it says 2 messages all the time but no matter what I do it never goes off..    ,

121,31 December 2017,5," Really useful to keep up-to-date with my data, minutes and texts. Also I can look at offers and upgrades, and if I need to add any bolt ons. There is also link to the online forum should I need it. Haven't had any problems with the app so far.    ",
122,10 January 2018,5," Great app. Easy to use. Integrates well with features on my phone like the fingerprint scanner. Gets a bit weird when you have two O2 contracts as you can't monitor multiple phones through the same app. However, this got sorted and I haven't had any issues since.    ",
123,3 January 2018,1, Tried using it today (4/01/18) and it keeps crashing out?! Can't remember when I last used it so don't know if the last update is the issue? I have an Honor 8 mobile phone. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling but still no joy :-/    ,
124,14 December 2017,5," Love it. Quite simply, it does what it's supposed to. I can easily check how much data I have left in my allowance, as well as see what chargeable calls or texts I've made/sent in the last few days. Tells me what my next bill will be, and gives me a breakdown of it, as well as let me pay my current bill. Not much more to ask for really. Note, I use a Galaxy A5 (2017). Admittedly, it would be nice to have kept it so it still accepts my fingerprint, without having to set that option as my phone's lock screen security, but hey, a pin number is just as quick as far as I'm concerned.    ",
125,19 January 2018,4, Would get 5stars if I could transfer an account to my Son after transferring the actual account. I have to do his top ups if he needs any!    ,
126,11 December 2017,5," Does all I want, main purpose is to tell me how much data I still have. To be fair I don't use it for much else, the local shop staff are brilliant so I do everything else there ‚ò∫Ô∏è    ",
127,11 December 2017,5, Decent enough app although it does crash on opening quite a lot! I'm happy that I can keep all the numbers on my contract in one place... it might be even better if all o2 apps could be in the same place as Well!    ,
128,17 December 2017,4, Does the intended job but suffers lots of start up crashes/errors. Great layout and I feel every aspect of my account is acessable    ,
129,29 December 2017,5," Really good. Always able to see what's left of my data and allowances. Only issue is that it keeps saying I have 1 bill ready, when I'm not the bill payer and it's from months ago.    ",
130,8 December 2017,2," Some update how they treat the customers. Just before the black friday 2017 i,v got the text from o2, that i have been selected as a loyality costumer to get??? a huge discount/deal for new phone/plan etc. They did text to me ""we will be contact with you after the upcoming black friday"", in fact that newer happenü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°, they even did not contact with me after all. My question are we can trust them??????  Frankly i can wait the time when my contract comes to and end AllelujaüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ.  Again my appeal to anyone who are about to sign up with them, just think twice before do that/this.    ",
131,14 January 2018,4," Really useful to keep tabs on everyone's usage, as I have both children on my contract. The only thing that lets it down is the technical issues that occur relatively frequently.    ",
132,15 January 2018,5," Handy, always seems to work and tells me what I want to know. The offers pop ups can be a bit tedious though.    ",
133,29 December 2017,3," It is a good app I can keep track of my bill and my kids but recently I'm not able to pay my contracts on it, it keeps telling me to contact my bank and come back and try again after I have spoken to them. I have done that their is no problem with my card or my account and yet I still can't pay through the o2 app üòï    ",
134,20 January 2018,5, It's simple and easy to use. Want to check your bill? No problem. Worried about how much data you have left?  A quick check and off you go.    ,
135,10 December 2017,3, Bit clunky but does the job. Crashes on startup about 50% of the time. Could be better.    ,
136,15 January 2018,3," Generally useful, but there used to be a circle icon showing how many days left of that billing period, which could be easily compared with the similar image showing how much data you had left, and it has gone from the latest versions. It was super helpful, please put it back!    ",
137,20 January 2018,5," Great app! Easy to use and connects to fingerprints so no one can access it.....easy to pay bills, add bundles, view future bills etc. Very handy to have especially on contract as it has all 3 of them in one place to track and check my data.    ",
138,24 December 2017,5," Great for checking out your bill or recent charges. Also, if you have two accounts they both show up.    ",
139,2 January 2018,4," Handy app for thoose who are on contract. So far so good, I'm just hopibg they can keep it up to update and reliable as mobile service apps have a habit of being poor.    ",
140,28 December 2017,5," Easy to use with quick tabs to break things down. First page tells me exactly what i need to know: Data, extra charges, texts left , minutes left.    ",
141,5 January 2018,4, This app is very useful. I can see how much data I'm using. Shame it doesn't work on Wi-Fi.    ,
142,11 December 2017,4, It's very easy to use. Only reservation is that no matter what I do I always seem to have an outstanding notification    ,
143,21 December 2017,4, Does what it's meant to do. Easy to understand tabs with minimal adverts/promo. Does occasionally crash when first opening. But still impressed    ,
144,8 December 2017,3, Handy little app. Can however be a bit temperamental at times.    ,
145,17 January 2018,5, I love it as I can keep track of our phone bills and if need be pay. That's the best thing as calling o2 can be stressful    ,
146,18 December 2017,4, Easy to use. Only thing to mention is for.some reason I always have to put in my pin even if not using WiFi.    ,
147,20 January 2018,5," Very good app. Those who said different, they are stupid. Thank You O2    ",
148,4 January 2018,5," I used to be on ee before switching to 02 ,  the ee app I had previous was awful compared to this very clear on things easy to use and we'll layed out unlike previous network    ",
149,28 December 2017,5," It does exactly as it says on the tin, sometimes the option to upgrade doesn't take you strait to the list of phones and tablets avaliable though if I do have one minor gripe.    ",
150,28 December 2017,5, U can easly pay off ur contract if u go over the top off minutes or texts and u can view ur bill at any time and u can see how much date u have uesed    ,
151,29 December 2017,4, it would be 5* but in the upgrade section it is damn near impossible to scroll down past the iPhone offers to the make/model selection as the page keeps pinging back to iPhone. I DO NOT WANT AN IPHONE    ,
152,4 January 2018,5, Handy app to have to track monthly activity. I haven't had any issues with the app on my Google device.    ,
153,16 December 2017,5, I think its great can't see any problems with it at all. Keep up the good work o2    ,
154,3 January 2018,5," Easy to use helps to keep up-to-date on current data & charges etc available - only criticism- frequently Asked Questions - What happens if yours Isn't? Hard to find contact number then to speak to a ""person""!    ",
155,4 January 2018,5," I love it, never had a problem. Has everything i need in one place. The data counter is the best thing for me!    ",
156,14 December 2017,4, Great app. But there have been a few instances when the data allowance has not been available to view for no apparent reason    ,
157,1 January 2018,5, Great app very easy 2 use I can keep track off how much I'm spending on my contract and pay off ne amount owed from the comfort of my home brill I can't recommend this app enough    ,
158,21 January 2018,5, Good app useful to have will keep to my five stars but seems slow on updating paid bills so makes you think there's still pay missing    ,
159,15 January 2018,5, I like the app only problem I have is it says 2 messages all the time but no matter what I do it never goes off..    ,
