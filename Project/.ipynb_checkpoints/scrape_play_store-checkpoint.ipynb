      "            Ric TheSeagull  8 December 2017                         Not the greatest app especially not ezactly pay as you go freindly. Would be nice if the first page you see wasn't log in details as being a new customer of O2, I found this very confusing at first (couldn't register for one thing). At least one can see what one has left on your Balance. Personally, could be better organised- 1st class service though, very helpful staff in the shop!  Full Review   \n",

Gets a bit weird when you have two O2 contracts as you can't monitor multiple phones through the same app. However, this got sorted and I haven't had any issues since.  Full Review   \n",

      "            Paul King  14 December 2017                         Love it. Quite simply, it does what it's supposed to. I can easily check how much data I have left in my allowance, as well as see what chargeable calls or texts I've made/sent in the last few days. Tells me what my next bill will be, and gives me a breakdown of it, as well as let me pay my current bill. Not much more to ask for really. Note, I use a Galaxy A5 (2017). Admittedly, it would be nice to have kept it so it still accepts my fingerprint, without having to set that option as my phone's lock screen security, but hey, a pin number is just as quick as far as I'm concerned.
